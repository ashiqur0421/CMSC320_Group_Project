        "# Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "The Titanic sinking is one of the most historically significant disasters with over 1,500 passengers losing their lives on April 15, 1912. The Titanic dataset has been studied to understand how different factors influence the survivability of passengers. The dataset contains a lot of numerical and categorical information about each passenger, making it a great dataset for analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "The goal of this project is to use machine learning techniques and train a Logistic Regression model to explore how different factors affected a passenger's chances of survival. Specifically, we want to answer the following questions:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.   What features (age, gender, passenger class, etc.) correlate most strongly with survival?\n",
        "\n",
        "      *   How does class, gender, and age affect survival?\n",
        "      *   Are there statistically significant differences in survival rates between 1st class vs. 3rd class, men vs. women, and children vs. adults?\n",
        "\n",
        "2.   Can we build a machine learning model to accurately predict whether a passenger survived based on their attributes?\n",
        "3.   How do precision, recall, and accuracy change as we vary the survival prediction cutoff?\n",
        "4.   How do the machine learning derived features' importance compare to our statistical findings?\n",
        "\n",
        "Understanding which passenger features correlate most strongly with survival on the Titanic is important because it allows us to verify historical narratives. For example, many of us have heard that women and children were given priority during evacuation, and we can verify this with statistical evidence from the dataset. Additionally, by identifying which features were most correlated with survival, we can better understand how social inequality, cabin class distribution, and other patterns shaped outcomes during this disaster.\n",
        "\n",
        "Evaluating whether our LR model can accurately predict survival is equally important because it demonstrates how well modern algorithms can learn from real data and highlights the challenges of classification when features are correlated or partially missing. This analysis strengthens our understanding of machine learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "Analyzing the precision, recall, and accuracy shows us the trade-offs our model has to make, and understanding this helps us choose the best cut-off for our case. Comparing machine learning features' importance with our statistical findings is also important because it tells us if different methods agree on which factors matter most and helps us understand how the model makes decisions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Together, these questions form a comprehensive exploration into the Titanic dataset by combining statistical inference, machine learning algorithms, and interpretability."

On contorary, their class seems to have the least impact on the surviability. The prominance of sex as the predictor indicates that contemporary social norm of protecting women. However, upon a test between the relationship of sex and passenger class, it is apparent that socioeconomic status does have an impact on those who survived."
