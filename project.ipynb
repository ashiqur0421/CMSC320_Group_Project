    "# Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "The Titanic sinking is one of the most historically significant disasters with over 1,500 passengers losing their lives on April 15, 1912. The Titanic dataset has been studied to understand how different factors influence the survivability of passengers. The dataset contains a lot of numerical and categorical information about each passenger, making it a great dataset for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to use machine learning techniques and train a Logistic Regression model to explore how different factors affected a passenger's chances of survival. Specifically, we want to answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.   What features (age, gender, passenger class, etc.) correlate most strongly with survival?\n",
    "\n",
    "      *   How does class, gender, and age affect survival?\n",
    "      *   Are there statistically significant differences in survival rates between 1st class vs. 3rd class, men vs. women, and children vs. adults?\n",
    "\n",
    "2.   Can we build a machine learning model to accurately predict whether a passenger survived based on their attributes?\n",
    "3.   How do precision, recall, and accuracy change as we vary the survival prediction cutoff?\n",
    "4.   How do the machine learning derived features' importance compare to our statistical findings?\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding which passenger features correlate most strongly with survival on the Titanic is important because it allows us to verify historical narratives. For example, many of us have heard that women and children were given priority during evacuation, and we can verify this with statistical evidence from the dataset. Additionally, by identifying which features were most correlated with survival, we can better understand how social inequality, cabin class distribution, and other patterns shaped outcomes during this disaster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluating whether our LR model can accurately predict survival is equally important because it demonstrates how well modern algorithms can learn from real data and highlights the challenges of classification when features are correlated or partially missing. This analysis strengthens our understanding of machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analyzing the precision, recall, and accuracy shows us the trade-offs our model has to make, and understanding this helps us choose the best cut-off for our case. Comparing machine learning features' importance with our statistical findings is also important because it tells us if different methods agree on which factors matter most and helps us understand how the model makes decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these questions form a comprehensive exploration into the Titanic dataset by combining statistical inference, machine learning algorithms, and interpretability."

    "The dataset contains passenger survival data of the Titanic, along with their identification (name and ticket number), and various factors that might have an effect on their survivability. These include their gender, age, relatives (who were aboard with them), their class (1st class, 2nd, or 3rd class), the fare rate they had to pay, and where they got on the ship from (Embarked).\n",
    "By doing the following exploratory analysis on the dataset, the relationships between passenger survivability and these factors were tested to see if any or all of them may have affected or even caused a passenger's survivability."

    "From the contigency table, we see that there is a statistically significant relationship between passenger class and survival outcome. There appears to be an association between passenger class and whether a passenger survived the Titanic. First class passengers were much more likely to survive, and this makes logical sense because they had better access to lifeboats and were given priority. The p-value is less than 0.05, meaning we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that passenger class is strongly associated with survival on the Titanic."

On other words, fair did have an effect on the survivibility of the passesgeners.\n",

    "From the contingency table, we see that there is a statistically significant relationship between the number of siblings/spouses aboard and survival outcome. Passengers with less siblings and spouses (SibSp is lower) had a lower chance of dying and higher chance of surviving compared to those with larger families. The Chi-squared test gives a p-value of approximately $1.56 \\cdot 10^{-6}$, which is far below 0.05. This means we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that SibSp is significantly associated with survival on the Titanic. It makes sense logically, as passengers with very large families may have had more difficulty escaping in time."

    "There are three ports from which passengers embarked on the titanic: Cherbourg (`C`), Queenstown (`Q`), and Southampton (`S`). We need to convert this categorical feature to a numeric feature. Due to the nature of our logistic regression model, we decided that the best way to do this would be to change each port to the survival rate of all passengers from that port. Specifically, we would assign `~0.337` to `S`, `~0.389` to `Q`, and `0.554` to `C`."

    "Our target variable, Survived, is a binary value. This means using regression for a continuous value wouldn’t fit because this target variable better aligns with a classification problem. An unsupervised approach, like clustering, would reveal certain patterns but would not answer the question of whether a passenger survived directly. So, with the existence of pre-labeled data for the outcome of each passenger, using a supervised classification approach makes the most sense.\n",

    "- Models the probability of a binary event, such as survived or died. We are then able to tune the probability threshold to balance the number of fall positives vs. false negatives.\n",
    "- Our exploratory data analysis shows several features that have strong relationships with whether a passenger survived or not. These include Passenger Class, Gender, and Age. Logistic regression can handle multiple encoded categorical variables and continuous values relatively well.\n",

    "This small difference suggests the initial model, while slightly better, is within performance expectations for the real world. Additional model complexity is likely unneeded since performance gains would be marginal. These results show the model generalizes well."
